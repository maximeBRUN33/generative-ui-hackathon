# Other Examples

Self-contained example modules. Each one demonstrates the next layer of A2UI customization beyond the dashboard demo.

## What goes here

This directory is the home for **content-complete examples that go one layer deeper than the dashboard demo**. The dashboard demo (and the `create-a2ui-widget` skill that adds to it) covers the 95% case — single catalog, pure-data widgets. Examples under `other-examples/` cover the 5% case where you need *new visual primitives, a second catalog, a different reading experience,* or a domain story that needs its own setting (legal paper, terminal kiosk, retail receipt, etc.).

Per [plan §3](https://www.notion.so/36e3aa38185281e49674f95ea7039b90), each example folder follows the same sub-repo layout:

```
other-examples/<example-id>/
├── README.md         # Standalone setup, screenshots, fork notes (opens with the §0.5 callout)
├── FRICTION.md       # Dogfooding log per §0.6 / §0.7
├── EXAMPLE.json      # Manifest read by the gallery — shape in §3.2
├── catalog/          # Zod schemas + React renderers (this is the "second catalog")
├── agent/            # LangGraph Python package — graph, tools, sample data
└── schemas/          # Component-tree adjacency lists + fixtures
```

**Sub-repo conventions** (from §3):

- Each example owns its `catalog/`, `agent/`, `schemas/`, and `EXAMPLE.json`
- Each `agent/` is a real Python package (`pyproject.toml` + `__init__.py`) — required by `langgraph build`
- No cross-imports between examples — a hacker can `cp -r <example>/ ~/my-new-repo/` and have the content (with the surgery in §3.1)
- Shared deps come from the parent `package.json` and `agent/pyproject.toml`
- The Next.js route lives at `src/app/(<group>)/<example-id>/page.tsx` as a thin shim — the *content* lives here, the *mount point* lives under `src/app/`

## How to add another

1. **Re-read [plan §0.6 dogfooding policy](https://www.notion.so/36e3aa38185281e49674f95ea7039b90).** The example must be built through the documented hackathon paths only — `pnpm new-widget`, the `create-a2ui-widget` skill, `AGENTS.md`, in-tree READMEs, validators. Every workaround gets a row in `FRICTION.md`.
2. **(Future) `pnpm new-widget --example <name>`.** When this generator ships, it will scaffold the sub-repo layout above so you don't hand-author the skeleton. Until then, copy `legal-contract-review/` and rename.
3. **Honesty about portability.** The §3.1 callout applies to every new example: the folder is content, not a complete repo. Document the host requirements (pinned deps, route shim, route-group layout, langgraph entry) in your example's README so a hacker who forks isn't surprised.
4. **Build the FRICTION.md as you go.** End-of-day cadence (17:00): convert friction rows to GitHub issues with the `dogfood-friction` label and the `hackathon-readiness-jun13` milestone. See §0.7 for the row template and label taxonomy.
5. **Add an entry to the index table above** and to the gallery — the gallery enumerates `other-examples/*/EXAMPLE.json` (see §3.2 for the shape).

> If you don't actually need a second catalog (you just want new widgets in the dashboard), use the `create-a2ui-widget` skill — much shorter path. The §0.5 callout in every example README spells out the distinction.
