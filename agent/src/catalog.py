"""The custom A2UI catalog. Python mirror.

CUSTOMIZATION SEAM #4 (agent-side mirror) — Add an A2UI component.
See HACKATHON.md §4. When you add a component to
src/a2ui/catalog/definitions.ts (+ a renderer in renderers.tsx), add a
one-line summary of it to CATALOG_PROMPT below or the agent will never
emit it.

This must stay in sync with src/a2ui/catalog/definitions.ts. Only the
catalog ID and the component prop summary live here; the JSON Schema for each
component is owned by the frontend (it's where the renderers are).

The agent reads CATALOG_PROMPT to know which components exist and what they
accept; createSurface uses CATALOG_ID so the runtime resolves to our renderers.

CATALOG_ID = "https://cpk-a2ui.local/catalogs/copilotkit/v1"

CATALOG_PROMPT = """\
## Available A2UI components. CopilotKit custom catalog

You may ONLY use the components listed here. Do not invent new component
types. All `id` values must be unique within the surface; exactly one
component must have `id: "root"`.

### Layout
- **Stack** { children: [ids] | { componentId, path }, gap?: xs|sm|md|lg|xl, align?: start|center|end|stretch }
    Vertical layout. The default container for surfaces and sections.
- **Row** { children: [ids], gap?: xs|sm|md|lg, justify?: start|center|end|spaceBetween, align?: start|center|end }
    Horizontal layout (wraps). Use for toolbars, metric rows, badge groups.
- **Grid** { children: [ids], columns?: 1-6, gap?: xs|sm|md|lg }
    Responsive grid. Use for stat-card rows and chart pairs.
- **Section** { title: string, eyebrow?: string, child: id }
    Titled section header + child container.
- **Card** { child: id, tone?: default|lilac|mint|warning }
    Bordered, padded surface. Pass a Stack/Row/Grid as child.
- **Divider** { }
    1px line.

### Content
- **Heading** { text: string|{path}, level?: "1"|"2"|"3" }
- **Text** { text: string|{path}, tone?: default|muted, size?: sm|md|lg, weight?: regular|medium|semibold }
- **Overline** { text: string|{path} }
    Tiny ALL-CAPS mono label above a heading. Also known as "overline" in typography.
- **Badge** { label: string|{path}, tone?: neutral|positive|warning|danger|info }
- **Callout** { body: string|{path}, title?: string|{path}, tone?: info|positive|warning|neutral }
    Block-level highlight for a key insight, definition, or warning. Use for "the takeaway" moments inside an explanation surface.
- **BulletList** { items: [string] | {path}, ordered?: bool }
    Bulleted or numbered list. Use for short enumerations like "three contributions" or "steps to reproduce".

### Data viz
- **StatCard** { label, value, delta?, deltaTone?: positive|negative|neutral, caption? }
    Single big-number metric.
- **BarChart** { data: [{label,value}], height?: 120-480 }
    Vertical bars. Use when labels are short (< 7 chars).
- **HorizontalBarChart** { data: [{label,value}], height?: 120-640 }
    Bars rendered as rows. Use for ranked lists with long labels (top customers, country names).
- **LineChart** { data: [{label,value}], height?: 120-480 }
    Trend where direction is the main signal.
- **DonutChart** { data: [{label,value}], height?: 120-480 }
    Share-of-total breakdown (3-6 slices).
- **ScatterChart** { data: [{x:number, y:number, label?}], xLabel?: string, yLabel?: string, height?: 160-560 }
    X/Y dots for correlation. Always provide xLabel and yLabel so the user knows what each axis is.
- **DataTable** { columns: [{key,label,align?}], rows: [record by column key] }

### Interactive (use only when the surface needs interactivity)
- **Button** { label, variant?: primary|secondary|ghost, action: { event: { name, context? } } }
- **ChoiceChips** { label, options: [{label,value}], value: {path}, multi?: bool }

### Study (Copilearn — use for learning surfaces)
- **Flashcard** { front: string, back: string, hint?: string }
    A click-to-flip study card. `front` = term/prompt, `back` = definition/answer.
    Put several in a Stack or Grid (columns 2) to make a deck.
- **QuizQuestion** { question: string, options: [string], correctIndex: int (0-based), explanation?: string }
    One multiple-choice practice question with instant right/wrong feedback.
    `correctIndex` points at the right option; `explanation` shows after answering.
    Put several in a Stack to make a quiz. ALWAYS set correctIndex to a real option index.
- **QuizGame** { title?: string, questions: [{question, options:[string], correctIndex:int, explanation?}] }
    A SCORED, gamified quiz — one question at a time with points, a streak bonus,
    and a final score screen. Use this (not a Stack of QuizQuestions) when the
    user wants to "play", be tested, or compete. `questions` is path-bindable.
- **ProgressTracker** { items: [{label, value: 0-100, tone?: default|positive|warning}] }
    Mastery bars, one per concept. `value` is percent mastered. Path-bindable.
- **RateShockSimulator** { title?, faceValue:number, couponRate:number, maturityYears:number, ytm:number, frequency?:number }
    Interactive bond interest-rate-risk simulator: a yield slider shows the bond's
    actual repriced value vs the duration-only and duration+convexity estimates.
    All bond math is computed in the widget — just pass the bond's parameters
    (couponRate/ytm are ANNUAL percents, e.g. 9 for 9%; frequency = coupons/year,
    default 2). Each numeric prop is path-bindable.

### Open generative UI (escape hatch — use ONLY when nothing above fits)
- **FreeformUI** { html: string, height?: number, title?: string }
    You author RAW, self-contained HTML/CSS/SVG (and optional inline <script>)
    and it renders in a SANDBOXED iframe. Reach for this only when the catalog
    above genuinely can't express what's needed: a bespoke diagram, a custom
    animation, a one-off interactive visual. Rules:
      * Fully self-contained. NO external URLs, stylesheets, fonts, images, or
        network calls — they are blocked by the sandbox/CSP. Use inline SVG for
        graphics and data: URIs for images.
      * The app's theme tokens are available as CSS variables: --ink, --ink-2,
        --line, --surface, --surface-soft, --lilac, --mint, --orange, --accent.
        Use them so it matches the app.
      * To send an action back to you, the HTML can call
        window.a2uiAction(name, context).
    Prefer the structured components above when they fit — they are more
    reliable. FreeformUI is the creative escape hatch, not the default.


### Rules
1. Exactly one component has id="root". Everything else must be reachable from root.
2. Repeating content uses `children: { componentId: "card-id", path: "/items" }`.
   Components INSIDE a List template use RELATIVE paths (no leading slash).
3. Chart `data` and DataTable `rows` may be inline arrays or `{ path: "/..." }`.
   When you pass `data` as a `{ path }` binding, populate that path via updateDataModel.
4. Inline values are preferred for everything else; do not use `{ path }`
   bindings on properties whose schema doesn't accept them.
5. Buttons must include an `action`. Action format:
   "action": { "event": { "name": "approve_plan", "context": { ... } } }
